The Guide is a resource document for use by faculty, staff, and design professionals for use during the planning and early design phases of a project. The Guide applies to construction projects for all Stanford University facilities, including leased properties.
 
The Guide is formatted to address laboratory design issues pertinent to General Laboratories (e.g., chemical laboratories) in Section 1, with additional requirements for Radioactive Materials Laboratories and Biosafety Level 2 Laboratories presented in Sections 2 and 3 respectively.
 
The majority of this document was adapted from the University of California Environmental Health and Safety Laboratory Safety Design Guide. Stanford University Environmental Health & Safety expresses great appreciation to University of California for all initial efforts put forth in its original development.

The primary objective in laboratory design is to provide a safe environment for laboratory personnel to conduct their work. A secondary objective is to allow for the maximum flexibility for safe research use. Undergraduate teaching laboratories require other specific design considerations. Therefore, all health and safety hazards must be anticipated and carefully evaluated so that protective measures can be incorporated into the design. No matter how well designed a laboratory is, improper usage of its facilities will always defeat the engineered safety features. Proper education of the facility users is essential.
 
The General Requirements listed in this section illustrate some of the basic health and safety elements to include in all new and remodeled laboratories at Stanford. Variations from these guidelines need approval from SU Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S). The subsections of Section 1.0 provide specific guidance on additional critical features of a general laboratory (e.g., fume hoods, hazardous materials storage, and compressed gases.)
 
2. Building Occupancy Classification- Occupancy classification is to be based upon an assessment of a projected chemical inventory of the building. Prior to the final design, the campus fire safety organization will need to assign an occupancy class to ensure compliance with the building codes.
 
3. Environmental Permits- Project managers must consult with SU EH&S to identify permitting and pollution abatement engineering requirements for the building. This should be done well before key resource allocation decisions are made.
 
Because the handling and storage of hazardous materials inherently carries a higher risk of exposure and injury, it is important to segregate laboratory and non-laboratory activities. In an academic setting, the potential for students to need access to laboratory personnel, such as instructors and assistants, is great. A greater degree of safety will result when nonlaboratory work and interaction is conducted in a space separated from the laboratory.
 
2. An automatically triggered main gas shutoff valve for the building shall be provided for use in a seismic event. In addition, interior manual shutoff valves shall be provided for both research and teaching areas.
 
4. Offices and write-up desks for laboratory personnel should be located outside of the laboratory space. Locating the office zones very close to the laboratory, preferably within the line of sight achieved via the use of glass walls or walls with viewing windows, will provide easy access, visibility, and communication.
 
It is important to segregate laboratory and non-laboratory activities because (1) the handling and storage of hazardous materials inherently carries a higher risk of exposure and injury; (2) the egress path from a lab desk to an exit should not require movement through a more hazardous zone; and (3) it is prohibited to store, consume food, apply make-up or chew gum in areas where hazardous materials are used and/or stored.
 
Having enclosed laboratories will help contain spills, keep unauthorized personnel from entering areas where hazardous operations are performed, etc. These regulations apply specifically to laboratories containing radioactive materials; however, Stanford University EH&S interprets this to include all laboratories (e.g., general chemistry and electronics).
 
**2. The laboratory shall have means of securing specifically regulated materials such as DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) controlled substances and CDC (Centers for Disease Control) select agents and radioactive materials (i.e., lockable doors, lockable cabinets, etc.).**
 
Having secured hazardous materials storage will keep unauthorized personnel from gaining access to them. These regulations apply specifically to laboratories containing radioactive materials and CDC Select Agents; however, Stanford University EH&S interprets this to include all laboratories (e.g., general chemistry and electronics).
 
Insects, particularly flies, are known to be a potential carrier of disease. To keep insects out of the lab, the doors must be closed while an experiment is in progress, and windows shall be screened if they are capable of being opened. These references apply specifically to laboratories containing biological materials; however, Stanford University EH&S interprets this to include all laboratories (e.g., general chemistry and electronics).
 
Floors should be coved up walls and cabinets to ensure spills cannot penetrate underneath floors/cabinets. Tiles and wooden planks are not appropriate because liquids can seep through the small gaps between them. These references apply specifically to laboratories containing biological and radioactive materials; however, Stanford University EH&S interprets this to include all laboratories (e.g., general chemistry, electronics, etc.).
 
Exposure to hazardous materials and/or pathogenic organisms can occur by hand-to-mouth transmission. It is extremely important that hands are washed prior to leaving the laboratory. For this very reason, the sink should be located close to the egress. These references apply specifically to laboratories containing biological and radioactive materials; however, Stanford University EH&S interprets this to include all laboratories (e.g., general chemistry and electronics).
 
**9. Sufficient space or facilities (e.g., storage cabinets with partitions) shall be provided so that incompatible chemicals/gases (waste and non-waste) can be physically separated and stored. This will be based on the chemical inventory and use projection provided by the Principal Investigator to the project and EH&S. If the project scope cannot provide sufficient storage the user must develop a written management control plan to include as part of their local Chemical Hygiene Plan.**
 
Materials which in combination with other substances may cause a fire or explosion, or may liberate a flammable or poisonous gas, must be kept separate. When designing the shelves, it is important to factor in enough space for secondary containers. Recommend that solvent storage not be located under the laboratory fume hood, as this is a location where fires are most likely to occur in laboratories.
 
All labs should be designed to conveniently and safely accommodate the temporary storage of biological, radiological, and chemicals (non-waste and waste) based on laboratory use projections. Wastes are generally stored in the lab in which they are generated, not in centralized accumulation areas.
 
**10.** **All furniture must be sturdy. All work surfaces (e.g., bench tops and counters) must be impervious to the chemicals used. The counter top should incorporate a lip to help prevent run-off onto the floor.**
 
For example, many microbiological manipulations involve concurrent use of chemical solvents such as formaldehyde, phenol, and ethanol as well as corrosives. The lab bench must be resistant to the chemical actions of these substances and disinfectants. Wooden bench tops are not appropriate because an unfinished wood surface can absorb liquids. Also, wood burns rapidly in the event of a fire. Fiberglass is inappropriate since it can degrade when strong disinfectants are applied. Fiberglass also releases toxic smoke when burned. These references apply specifically to laboratories containing biological and radioactive materials; however, Stanford University EH&S interprets this to include all laboratories (e.g., general chemistry and electronics).
 
**11.** **Vented cabinets with electrical receptacles and sound insulation should be provided for the placement of individual vacuum pumps where their use is anticipated. A one- to two-inch hole for the vacuum line hose from the cabinet to the bench top should be provided.**
